## The rich man and Lazarus

There was a rich man who wore luxury clothes and had grand celebrations every day.

There was a poor man named Lazarus, who was full of sores on his body. The poor man was thrown at the gate of the rich man's mansion. He begs to eat even the crumbs of food that fell from the rich man's table. Dogs came to him and licked his sores.

Lazarus died and the angels carried him to Abraham's embrace.

The rich man also died and was buried.

In Hades, the rich man was in great suffering. He looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus beside him.

The rich man called out, "Father Abraham, please have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue. Because I am tortured in this fire."

Abraham replied, "Child, remember that you had received good things in your life, while Lazarus had the bad things. Now he is comforted here, and you are suffering. And besides, there is a very wide space between you and us, so that no one can cross."

The rich man begged, "Then I beg you, Father Abraham. Send Lazarus to my family's house. I have five brothers. He should warn them so that they do not end up like me."

But Abraham said, "Your brothers have the Bible. They should hear the word of God."

The rich man insisted, "No, Father Abraham, but if someone rises from the dead and goes to them, they will change."

Abraham told him, "If they do not hear the word of God in the Bible, they will not believe even if someone comes back from the dead."

## Build up treasures in heaven

Do not accumulate earthly possessions, which can be destroyed by moths, rust, or stolen by thieves.

Instead, focus on building up treasures in heaven, where nothing can destroy or take them away.

Remember, wherever your treasure is, there your heart will also be.

Sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor.

By doing so, you'll have treasure in heaven.

Then, come and follow me.

## If you love me

If you love me, you will keep my commands.

This is my command: Love each other, exactly the way I love you.

References: John 14:15, John 15:12

## If the world hates you

Be aware that if the world hates you, it hated me first.

If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.

But because you are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of it, that is why the world hates you.

But love your enemies and pray for them.

In the world, you will have trouble. But in me, you have peace.

Do not be afraid, I have conquered the world.

Go into all the world and share the good news with everyone.

References: John 15:18-19, Matthew 5:44, John 16:33, Mark 16:15

## Guard yourselves from greed

Beware and guard yourselves from all greed.

Because your life is not in the abundance of your possessions.

Reference: Luke 12:15
