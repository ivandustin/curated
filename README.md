## The rich man and Lazarus

There was a rich man who wore luxury clothes and had grand celebrations every day.

There was a poor man named Lazarus, who was full of sores on his body. The poor man was thrown at the gate of the rich man's mansion. He begs to eat even the crumbs of food that fell from the rich man's table. Dogs came to him and licked his sores.

Lazarus died and the angels carried him to Abraham's embrace.

The rich man also died and was buried.

In Hades, the rich man was in great suffering. He looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus beside him.

The rich man called out, "Father Abraham, please have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip his finger in water and cool my tongue. Because I am tortured in this fire."

Abraham replied, "Child, remember that you had received good things in your life, while Lazarus had the bad things. Now he is comforted here, and you are suffering. And besides, there is a very wide space between you and us, so that no one can cross."

The rich man begged, "Then I beg you, Father Abraham. Send Lazarus to my family's house. I have five brothers. He should warn them so that they do not end up like me."

But Abraham said, "Your brothers have the Bible. They should hear the word of God."

The rich man insisted, "No, Father Abraham, but if someone rises from the dead and goes to them, they will change."

Abraham told him, "If they do not hear the word of God in the Bible, they will not believe even if someone comes back from the dead."

## Build up treasures in heaven

Do not accumulate earthly possessions, which can be destroyed by moths, rust, or stolen by thieves.

Instead, focus on building up treasures in heaven, where nothing can destroy or take them away.

Remember, wherever your treasure is, there your heart will also be.

Sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor.

By doing so, you'll have treasure in heaven.

Then, come and follow me.

References: Matthew 6:19-21, Matthew 19:21

## If you love me

If you love me, you will keep my commands.

This is my command: Love each other, exactly the way I love you.

References: John 14:15, John 15:12

## If the world hates you

Be aware that if the world hates you, it hated me first.

If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own.

But because you are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of it, that is why the world hates you.

But love your enemies and pray for them.

In the world, you will have trouble. But in me, you have peace.

Do not be afraid, I have conquered the world.

Go into all the world and share the good news with everyone.

References: John 15:18-19, Matthew 5:44, John 16:33, Mark 16:15

## Guard yourselves from greed

Beware and guard yourselves from all greed.

Because your life is not in the abundance of your possessions.

Reference: Luke 12:15

## Love me more than others

Whoever loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.

Whoever loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.

Whoever finds their life will lose it.

Whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.

If anyone comes to me and does not hate their own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—they cannot be my disciple.

Whoever does not carry their own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.

References: Matthew 10:37-39, Luke 14:26-27

## If you keep my word

Truly, Truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he shall never see death forever.

Reference: John 8:51

## Committing adultery

You heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery."

But I say to you that all who looks at a woman to lust at her has already committed adultery on her in his heart.

Now if your right eye is causing you to sin, take it out, and throw it away from you. For it is profitable for you that one of the parts of your body be destroyed, and not your whole body be thrown into hell.

And if your right hand is causing you to sin, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is profitable for you that one of the parts of your body be destroyed, and not your whole body go into hell.

Reference: Matthew 5:27-30

## Love your enemies

You heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor, and hate your enemy."

But I say to you, love your enemies.

Bless those who curse you.

Do good to those who hate you.

And pray for the sake of those who revile and persecute you.

So that you may become sons of your Father, who is in Heaven.

Because He causes His Sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sends rain upon the righteous and the unjust.

For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Does not also the tax collectors do the same?

And if you greet your brothers, only, what more are you doing? Does not also the non-believers do the same?

Therefore, be perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect.

Reference: Matthew 5:43-48

## The truth will set you free

If you stay in my word, you are truly my disciples.

And you will know the truth.

And the truth will set you free.

Reference: John 8:31-32

## Pray in secret

When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites.

Because they love to stand and pray in public places, so that they may be seen by others.

Truly, I say to you, their prayers will not be heard.

But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret.

And your Father, who sees in secret, will answer your prayers.

Reference: Matthew 6:5-6

## The will of my Father

This is the will of my Father:

Everyone who looks at the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life.

I will resurrect him on the last day.

Reference: John 6:40

## I am the bread of life

I am the bread of life.

He who comes to me will never be hungry.

And he who believes in me will never, ever be thirsty.

Reference: John 6:35

## Forgive

If you forgive people for their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

But if you do not forgive people for their sins, neither your Father will forgive your sins.

Reference: Matthew 6:14-15

## I am the vine

I am the vine. You are the branches.

He who stays in me and I in him, he is the one that bears much fruit.

Because without me, you can do nothing.

Reference: John 15:5

## I will give you rest

Come to me all who are exhausted and overloaded, and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, because I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

For my yoke is good, and my load is light.

Reference: Matthew 11:28-30

## Eat me

Truly, truly, I say to you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.

The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will resurrect him on the last day.

For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.

The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood stays in me and I in him.

Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father. So is the one who eats me, and he will live because of me.

Reference: John 6:53-57
